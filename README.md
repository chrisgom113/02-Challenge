# Week One Challenge

## Description

The task for this project consisted of starter code with both HTML and CSS for a web application that was in an "imperfect" state, and it was my job to ensure that the functionality of the application actually worked (page links). 

Additionally, there were a few issues in the starter code that involved lack of accessibility, as well as a few other minor alterations to be done. It was also my job to look through both the HTML and CSS files to ensure that the code was consolidated to a decent level of efficiency, and also to ensure semantic structuring was present should another coder aside from myself need to read and quickly recognize what the code meant.

Lastly, the completed app is deployed as a live webpage to complete the task.

The project is extremely good practice for getting into the deep levels of reading HTML and CSS code. There is a lot of stumbling and going back and forth that creates a repetitive interaction between myself (brain) and understanding what I'm looking at. Messing up, trying again, rinse and repeat, etc., was highly beneficial and undoubtedly helped develop the skillset further.
